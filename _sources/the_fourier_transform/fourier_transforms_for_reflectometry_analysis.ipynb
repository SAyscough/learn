    "\n",
    "In specular neutron reflectometry, we understand that $q_x = 0$ and $q_y = 0$, which is to say that the neutrons are scattered **only** in the surface normal (perpendicular to the plane of the surface), denoted $z$. \n",
    "A result of this, is that by applying the [Born approximation](), the measured reflectometry can be found from the Fourier transform of the **first derivative** of the scattering length density profile with respect to $z$ {cite}`sivia_elementary_2011`.\n",
