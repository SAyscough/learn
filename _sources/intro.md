# Introduction to neutron reflectometry fitting

The aim of this course, and the companion lecture, are to give an introduction to the following subjects: 
- the Fourier transform and how a Born approximation approach my be used to analyse neutron reflectometry data; 
- the logic of model-dependent analysis; 
- neutron reflectometry *slab* models and their traditional parameterisation; 
- reparameterisation of these models to include chemical and physical insight; and 
- the process and problems associated with fitting in a model-dependent analysis procedure. 

This course was originally developed by [Andrew McCluskey](mailto:andrew.mccluskey@ess.eu) from the European Spallation Source for the [ISIS Virtual Reflectometry Training Course](https://indico.stfc.ac.uk/event/355/). 

```{note}
In this course, we make use of the Python programming language heavily to show mathematics and plot figures. 
The aim is that the course should not require knowledge of Python to understand the content.
If you are not comfortable with Python, feel free to skip the code blocks, but make sure to pay attention to the plots that are produced.
