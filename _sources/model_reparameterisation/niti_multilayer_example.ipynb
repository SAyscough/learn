    "# NiTi multilayer example\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first example, we will consider a simple hard matter system, where there is a **repeating multilayer** of nickel and titanium that has been deposited on the surface of a piece of silicon. \n",
    "The process by which these systems are prepared typically involves the disposition of a layer of titanium, followed by a layer of nickel, followed by titanium, this process is repeated until the desired number of layers is reached. \n",
    "Below we show, graphically, a model that we may use for the simulation of reflectometry data from such a system. \n",
